# Where our story begins
Our story begins as most do in a town that seems ordinary but holds many secrets.  This journal is my journey through out the town and the adventures that I have along with the inhhabitants of that town.  All of these adventures are alone to start but they don't stay that way for I may find others to aid me on my quests.

## Who I am
I am a dragonborn sorcerer which means that I am a descendent of dragons (a gold one to be preceise) and that magic is a part of me.  I am born with the ability to do magic unlike wizards who must study it.  I am still young and learning my abilities though some see my appearance and have some interesting reactions to it.


## My traits
- Dragonic Strength
- Fluent in magic
- Somewhat charismatic


## My Goals and Objectives

1. Explore the world
2. Find treasure
3. Find others like me
4. Improve my arcane abilities

## My character 

>  Race: Dragonborn (Gold Dragon) <br>
>  Class: Sorcerer <br>
>  Level: 1
